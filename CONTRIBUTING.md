Contributing
----------------------------------

1. File an issue to notify us about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, add or update what's needed.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

File an Issue
----------------------------------

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/force11/FAIR4RS/issues) 
to start the discussion or ask questions about updates. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
we need to discuss more. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to hash that all out.

Fork the Repository
-------------------

Be sure to check your changes before making the pull request. 

Make the Pull Request
---------------------

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation,
make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the
`repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these
changes.
